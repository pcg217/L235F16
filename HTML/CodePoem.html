<title>"It's Just Words"</title>

    <center>Words hold weight. Some more than others, </center>
    <center>but they are special little, sometimes long,</center>
    <center>twisted letters that tell us stories,</center>
    <center>that educate us, that shape our perspective-- </center>
    <center>consciously or unconsciously. We choose </center>
    <center>how we process words, we have language, we have</center>
    <center>opportunity. Let there be weight in your words.</center>
